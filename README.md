# Modernist Recipe Card

Paste a recipe URL, get it rendered in the distinctive style popularized by the *Modernist Cuisine* book series.

## What It Does

Takes a recipe from any URL and reformats it into a professional, precision-focused layout featuring:

- Weight-based measurements with baker's percentages for scaling
- Dual-unit formatting (metric primary, imperial secondary)
- Two layout formats: **Format A** (labeled steps + separate ingredients table) and **Format B** (integrated ingredient-procedure table)
- Clean, editorial typography using the Modernist Cuisine design language

## Project Status

**Pre-v1** — project scaffolding and infrastructure in progress.

See [BACKLOG.md](./BACKLOG.md) for the roadmap and [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md) for history.
